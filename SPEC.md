---

### 1.4 SlimeGenome (Genetic Entity)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `Uuid` | Stable unique identifier |
| `name` | `String` | Display name |
| `culture_expr` | `CultureExpression` | 6-float vector, sums to 1.0 |
| `base_hp` | `f32` | Hit points (20.0 × culture_mod × 0.85–1.15) |
| `base_atk` | `f32` | Attack (5.0 × culture_mod) |
| `base_spd` | `f32` | Speed (5.0 × culture_mod) |
| `level` | `u8` | 0–10 |
| `xp` | `u32` | Current XP toward next level |

**`genetic_tier()`**: derived from `CultureExpression` — see §3.
**`life_stage()`**: derived from `level` — see §4.

---

### 1.5 CultureExpression

`[f32; 6]` indexed as `[Ember, Gale, Marsh, Crystal, Tundra, Tide]`.
**Invariant:** `values.iter().sum() ≈ 1.0` (enforced on construction and after every breed).

**`dominant()`**: returns the `Culture` with the highest expression value.
**`active_count()`**: cultures with expression ≥ 0.05.

---

### 1.6 GameState (Persistence Root)

```json
{
  "roster":      [Operator, ...],
  "bank":        u64,
  "deployments": [Deployment, ...],
  "missions":    [Mission, ...],
  "slimes":      [SlimeGenome, ...]   // Sprint 1 — was missing in Python
}
```

`slimes` uses `#[serde(default)]` — missing on old saves → empty `Vec` (backward compatible).

---

## 2. Success Formula (Operator Missions)

```
per_attr_score   = min(squad_total / threshold, 1.0)
                   [0.0 if threshold > 0 and squad provides zero]
average_score    = (str_score + agi_score + int_score) / 3.0
success_chance   = average_score × (1.0 − difficulty)
```

| Roll vs. success_chance | Outcome |
|------------------------|---------|
| `roll < success_chance` | **Victory** → `bank += reward`; all operators → `Idle` |
| `roll ≥ success_chance AND roll < 0.95` | **Failure** → all operators `Injured(now + duration × 2s)` |
| `roll ≥ 0.95` | **Critical Failure** → one random operator removed from roster |

> **5% floor is permanent.** Cannot be reduced by statistics.

---

## 3. Genetic Tier Resolution

Tier is computed from the number of **active cultures** (`expression ≥ 0.05`) and their hexagon relationship.

```
active_count == 1                          → Tier 1  Blooded
active_count == 2, cultures are adjacent   → Tier 2  Bordered
active_count == 2, cultures are opposite   → Tier 3  Sundered
active_count == 2, cultures skip-one       → Tier 4  Drifted
active_count == 3                          → Tier 5  Threaded
active_count == 4                          → Tier 6  Convergent
active_count == 5                          → Tier 7  Liminal
active_count == 6                          → Tier 8  Void
```

**Hex adjacency map:**
```
Ember → [Gale, Marsh]      Crystal → [Gale, Tide]
Gale  → [Ember, Tundra]    Marsh   → [Ember, Tide]
Tide  → [Crystal, Marsh]   Tundra  → [Gale, Marsh]
```

**Opposites:** Ember↔Crystal, Gale↔Tundra, Marsh↔Tide

## 4. LifeStage Gate

| Level | Stage | can_dispatch | can_breed | can_mentor |
|-------|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0–1 | Hatchling | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| 2–3 | Juvenile | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| 4–5 | Young | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| 6–7 | Prime | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| 8–9 | Veteran | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| 10 | Elder | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**XP curve:** `xp_to_next = (level + 1) × 100`

---

## 5. Breeding Resolution (`BreedingResolver::breed`)

Error if either parent's `life_stage().can_breed() == false`.

**Step 1 — Culture blending:**
```
for each culture i:
    blended    = (a.expr[i] + b.expr[i]) / 2.0
    variance   = uniform(−0.15, +0.15)
    raw[i]     = max(0.0, blended + variance × blended)
normalise(raw) so sum == 1.0
```

**Step 2 — Stat inheritance (three rules + ratchet):**
```
HP  = ratchet(max(a.hp,   b.hp),                cap, mutation)
ATK = ratchet((a.atk + b.atk) / 2.0,            cap, mutation)
SPD = ratchet(max(a.spd, b.spd) * 0.95,          cap, mutation)

cap      = base_stat × culture_modifier × 2.0
ratchet  = current + (cap − current) × 0.10
           then maybe mutate: 70% → ×1.25, 30% → ×0.85
           then clamp to cap
```

Default mutation chance = **5%**. Void parentage forces ≥ **15%**.

**Step 3 — Visual dominance:**
- Dominant parent = higher peak culture expression
- 80% chance dominant's shape/pattern used; 20% recessive
- 10% chance one RGB channel ±30 color mutation
- Elder bonus: +20% chance rare accessory even if roll said `None`

**Step 4 — Personality:**
- Each of `[curiosity, energy, affection, shyness]`: `avg ± uniform(−0.10, +0.10)`, clamped `[0.0, 1.0]`

**Output:** New `SlimeGenome` with `generation = max(a, b) + 1`, `level = 0`, `xp = 0`.

---

## 6. Narrative Engine (`log_engine::generate_narrative`)

Classifies mission by dominant stat requirement:

| Dominant stat | `MissionType` | Narrative pool |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| STR | Assault | 5 "breaching" templates |
| AGI | Stealth | 5 "shadow" templates |
| INT | Cyber | 5 "hacking" templates |
| Balanced | Balanced | 4 general templates |

`{op}` token → first operator's name.
`format_log_entry` wraps with `[mission_name] OUTCOME — narrative`.
Log capped at 50 entries (newest first). UI: resizable scrollable panel, color-coded by outcome.

---

## 7. Persistence Contract

- **Save file:** `save.json` (working directory)
- **Write strategy:** atomic → `.json.tmp` → `fs::rename` (see ADR-003)
- **Load policy:** absent file → fresh `GameState::new_with_seed_missions()`
- **Corrupt file:** surface `PersistenceError::Json` — never silently overwrite

---
